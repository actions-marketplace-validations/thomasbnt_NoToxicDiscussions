### üò∂ Disclaimer : Read that before use it

For this moment, this **GitHub Actions** don't work properly like I would like. When GitHub add the possibility to add *and/or* edit comments in Discussions, i will update the project.

I started this Action because I thinked  that it is a good idea to have a moderate tool in Discussions part with the toxicity of comments.
So I did it thinking it would be feasible, but when I got to the end of the code part, I couldn't figure out how to create/edit comments.
