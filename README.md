### üò∂ Disclaimer : Read this before using it

For the moment, this **GitHub Action** doesn't work as properly as I would like. When GitHub adds the possibility to add *and/or* edit comments in Discussions, I will update the project.

I started this Action because I thought that it is a good idea to have a moderation tool in the Discussions part with the toxicity of comments.
So I did it thinking it would be feasible, but when I got to the end of the code part, I couldn't figure out how to create/edit comments.

# No Toxic Discussions

> A GitHub action that detects toxic messages in Discussions.

**No Toxic Discussions** uses the **Perspective API** by *Jigsaw* from Google.

## How it works 

When anyone creates a new comment in a discussion or creates a new discussion, the script will check if the comment is toxic. 
If the author edits their comment, the Action will run again.
